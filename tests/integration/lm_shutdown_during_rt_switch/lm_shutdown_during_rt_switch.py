    Objective: Verifies that the Launch Manager exits after performing a shutdown
    (stopping all processes it owns) when requested via SIGTERM, and that this
    shutdown takes priority over an in-progress run-target switch (the switch is
    cancelled).

    The control client activates run_target_a and then requests a switch to
    run_target_c. component_a (only part of run_target_a) stalls while it is being
    terminated during the switch, keeping the switch in progress. That window is
    signalled by the file `component_a_terminating`, at which point the launch
    manager is sent a SIGTERM.

    Expected Behaviour: The launch manager cancels the pending switch - so
    component_c (only part of run_target_c) is never started - stops all the
    processes it owns, and exits cleanly.

    # client additionally asserts that run_target_c was never activated.
