    Objective: Verifies that the Launch Manager shuts a process down by sending a
    SIGTERM and, if the process does not terminate itself in time, escalates to a
    SIGKILL.

    The control daemon activates the "Running" run target (starting the managed
    shutdown_signal_process), then switches back to "Startup". The shutdown_signal_process installs a
    SIGTERM handler that records its PID and then deliberately blocks instead of
    terminating, forcing the Launch Manager to send SIGKILL. Finally the control
    daemon activates "Off".

    Expected Behaviour: shutdown_signal_process receives a SIGTERM (proven by the
    `sigterm_received` file, which holds the PID it wrote before blocking and
    therefore survives SIGKILL) and is then force-terminated by SIGKILL (proven by
    that PID no longer existing, since the process never self-terminates).
