    Objective: Verifies that the Launch Manager exits after performing a shutdown
    (stopping all processes it owns) when a SIGTERM arrives while an explicit switch
    to the "Off" run target is already in progress.

    The control client activates run_target_a and then explicitly requests a switch
    to the "Off" run target. component_a (part of run_target_a) stalls while it is
    being terminated during that switch, keeping the switch to Off in progress. That
    window is signalled by the file `component_a_terminating`, at which point the
    launch manager is sent a SIGTERM.

    Expected Behaviour: The launch manager lets the in-progress switch to Off
    continue, stops all the processes it owns, and exits cleanly. It honours each
    component's shutdown_timeout, so component_a - which stalls for less than its
    shutdown_timeout - exits gracefully (producing its XML result) rather than being
    force-terminated.
