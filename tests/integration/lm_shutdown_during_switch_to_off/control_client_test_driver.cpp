// The Launch Manager shall exit after performing a shutdown - stopping all the
// processes it owns in dependency order - when requested (i.e. when it receives
// a SIGTERM).
//
// This variant differs from lm_shutdown_during_rt_switch: instead of switching
// to another (non-Off) run target, the control client explicitly switches to
// the "Off" run target. component_a (part of run_target_a) stalls while it is
// being terminated during that switch, so the switch to Off is still in progress
// when the test sends a SIGTERM to the launch manager from the Python side.
//
// Because the process group is ALREADY heading to Off, the SIGTERM-triggered
// shutdown must simply let that in-progress switch to Off continue to completion
// - it must NOT cancel the explicit switch to Off and redo it. Either way the
// launch manager must end up stopping everything it owns and exit cleanly.
