// Given a configuration with two run targets, each pulling in a self-terminating component whose
// ready condition is "Terminated" but which differ in whether that component has a dependent:
//
//   - run_target_reader:     filesystem_reader (ready "Running") depends on setup_filesystem_sh
//                            (self-terminating, ready "Terminated"). The terminated-ready
//                            component HAS a dependent.
//   - run_target_slow_setup: depends directly on slow_setup_sh (self-terminating, ready
//                            "Terminated") which has NO dependent component.
//
// In both cases the run target must only report success once the terminated-ready component's
// process has actually exited. Without the fix, graph accounting for such a node happens as soon as
// the process is *started*, so ActivateRunTarget(...).Get() returns while the script is still
// running and its marker file has not been written yet.
