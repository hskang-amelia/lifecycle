    Objective: Verifies that a Run Target becomes ready only once a self-terminating component's
    process has actually exited, both when the terminated-ready component has a dependent and when
    it has none.

    A control client (control_client_test_driver) activates two run targets in sequence:
      - run_target_reader:     filesystem_reader (ready "Running") depends on setup_filesystem_sh
                               (self-terminating, ready "Terminated"). The terminated-ready
                               component HAS a dependent, so filesystem_reader finds the prepared
                               file and confirms the script process is gone.
      - run_target_slow_setup: depends directly on slow_setup_sh (self-terminating, ready
                               "Terminated") which has NO dependent. slow_setup_sh waits briefly
                               before writing its marker file; the control client verifies that
                               the marker exists once activation completes, i.e. the run target
                               only became ready once the process had terminated.

    Expected Behaviour: Both activations complete only after the respective terminated-ready
    component's process has exited.

    Note: The two self-terminating components (setup_filesystem_sh and slow_setup_sh) are implemented as
    dummy shell scripts which write a file on completion, emulating a real use case like setting up a
    filesystem or performing a slow setup operation.
