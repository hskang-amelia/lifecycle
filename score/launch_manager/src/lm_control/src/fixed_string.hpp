/// Stores a null-terminated string in a plain `std::array` of size `MaxLength + 1`.

/// a bounded string length is acceptable.
///
/// @tparam MaxLength Maximum number of usable characters, excluding the null terminator.
///                   The internal storage is `MaxLength + 1` bytes so the terminator
///                   always fits.
///
/// @par Invariant
/// The stored string is always null-terminated. Every constructor and assignment path
/// enforces this. Characters beyond the null terminator are indeterminate and must
/// not be read directly - use `as_string_view()` or `data()` instead.
///
/// @par Copying and moving
/// Copy and move are compiler-generated (rule of zero). The `std::array` storage
/// carries no heap resource, so the generated forms are correct and efficient.
///
/// @par Ordering
/// No `operator<` is provided. `FixedString` values have no meaningful ordering.
///
/// @par Cross-capacity comparison
/// `FixedString<N>` and `FixedString<M>` are distinct types, but free-function
/// `operator==` / `operator!=` overloads allow comparing them by string content.
